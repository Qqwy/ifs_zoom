-- | The top-left and bottom-right bounds of the area, respectively.
type Bounds = (Point, Point)

-- | A collection of bounds.
-- This BST is expected to be 2^n elements large,
-- allowing us to know exactly how many children each element has
-- without storing extra data.
--
-- Note that the BST will not store the points itself,
-- since those only need half the storage
-- (the lower and upper bound are the same for a single point)
type BinarySearchTree = Vector Bounds

-- | Builds a binary search tree bottom-up.
-- Note that this function takes `depth` which is a power of two.
-- It uses metaprogramming to create a program that combines
-- exactly 2^depth points together
-- forming a BST with `(2^depth)/2 - 1` internal nodes.
--
-- The node at index 0 is the root
-- index (1, 2) its children
-- etc
--
-- In general, children of a node at index `i` Ã re at indexes `i*2` and `i*2+1`.
